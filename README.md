Social Media Post Management System
This project implements a basic backend for managing social media posts using C++. The functionality includes adding new posts, finding posts by a specific poster, and deleting posts. The data structure used to manage the posts is a stack, which ensures that posts are handled in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.
